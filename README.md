# SkillBridge: Local Skills Exchange & Learning Community App

## üéØ Concept Overview
SkillBridge is a mobile application that connects people in local communities to exchange skills, knowledge, and micro-learning opportunities. The app combines elements of social networking, skill marketplace, and gamified learning in a unique hyperlocal context.

### Core Features (MVP)
- **Skill Mapping**: Users can map their skills and learning interests
- **Local Matching**: AI-powered matching of learners with nearby skill-sharers
- **Micro-Learning Sessions**: 15-30 minute skill-sharing sessions
- **Trust System**: Community-driven rating and verification system
- **Time Banking**: Exchange system based on time credits

## üîç Market Analysis
### Target Audience
- Primary: Young professionals (25-40) looking to expand their skill set
- Secondary: Retirees and experts wanting to share their knowledge

### Unique Value Proposition
1. Hyperlocal focus unlike global platforms
2. Time-based exchange system instead of monetary transactions
3. Focus on micro-learning sessions rather than long-term commitments
